Objective

The goal of this assignment is to implement algorithms for strongly connected components (Tarjan’s Algorithm), condensation graph construction, and topological sorting.
Additionally, multiple datasets of different sizes were generated and tested to evaluate the correctness and performance of these algorithms.
